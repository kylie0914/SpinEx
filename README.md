## SpinEx
This is the github repo for the paper "Integrated disc-fluidics enables high-throughput sample processing for the analysis of extracellular vesicles". SpinEx-ML is a practical utility to evaluate SpinEx. We used the obtained data using SpinEx for cancer diagnostics and classification. We focused on five prevalent tumor types, breast, lung, liver, pancreas, and colon, as potential detection targets. In addition, non-cancer control samples were obtained from non-cancer donors.
